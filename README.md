# MixtureModelGenerator
Two real-valued data stream generators based on mixture models: MixtureModelGenerator and MixtureModelGeneratorDrift. These generators are without concept drift and with concept drift respectively. The approach is inspired by Webb et al.'s Bayesian Network structured categorical data generator (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.35005) [2]. 

Designed to be compatible with the MOA (Massive Online Analysis) 17.06 release. MOA [1] is a Java-based, open source framework for data stream mining. More details can be found on its website (https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) and it can be found on GitHub as well (https://github.com/waikato/moa).

These classes include the Apache Commons Mathematics Library as a dependency. The Apache Commons Mathematics Library is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common problems not available in the Java programming language or Commons Lang. More details as well as download links can be found on the library's website (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/).
